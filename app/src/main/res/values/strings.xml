    <string name="texto_intro"><b>Are you thinking about donating blood ?</b>\n \nDonating blood is a social need. In order to supply these needs in Spain, there are about 40 donations per 1000 inhabitants per year. \n \n
<b>Why should we donate blood?</b> \n \nThe main reason is that blood can not be produced. It only can be obteined by donors like you.\nOn the other hand, blood is essential in surgeries and emergencies. Also blood expires, and can not be stored indefinitely. \nSo please do not forgetâ€¦.
With just one donation three persons get healed.\nRemember that your donation is necessary throughout the year. So try to donate before the holiday periods. In these periods donations decrease drastically, while the needs are the same all along the year.\n \n<b>If you want to know if you are elegible to donate, please go through this easy and quick test.</b></string>
